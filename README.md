# Continuous spectral volume rendering

Adaptation of VPT with support for continuous spectral volume rendering.

## Abstract
Path tracing applications often overlook wave optics and wavelength dependency effects, impacting the accuracy of visual representations. This paper presents the integration of continuous spectral rendering support into the VPT framework (Lesar et al. 2018) to simulate wave optics effects. Spectral rendering, which accounts for wavelength-specific photon behavior, enhances scene realism by providing a more accurate depiction of light interaction with materials. We developed a spectral volume renderer, leveraging WebGL and Python for implementation and validation. Key wavelength-dependent phenomena, such as Rayleigh scattering, fluorescence, and metamerism, are simulated, demonstrating the renderer's capability to produce realistic visual effects. The implementation involves enhancing the Monte-Carlo path tracing algorithm with spectral characteristics and using Gaussian approximations of CIE 1931 color matching functions for accurate color transformations.
